	* WARNING: "hash mismatch" on OpenBSD (server/client)
	  In some cases, the client shows an error message "hash mismatch" and
	  fails to update repositories. This problem is caused by reason that
	  native OpenBSD SHA-1 implementation is not thread safe.

	  Workaround:
		1. Specifies "hash md5" in your configuration file.
		2. Rebuild the server/client with HAVE_SHA1=no or
		   HASH_TYPE={libgcrypt,mhash,openssl}.

	  This problem is reported to OpenBSD mailing list by Sato-san and
	  fixed in the current OpenBSD tree. See the following URL.

2003-05-11  MAEKAWA Masahide  <maekawa@cvsync.org>

	* New feature: access

	  It provides the way to control to allow/deny the connections.

		allow <v4addr>[/<netmask>][,<max>]
		allow <v6addr>[/<prefixlen>][,<max>]
		allow <domain>[,<max>]
			'allow' specifies the acceptable address block and
			the acceptable domain name. <max> means the maximum
			connections from the address block or the domain name.
			Even if <max> is greater than 'maxclient', the maximum
			is restricted by the value of 'maxclient'.

		always <v4addr>[/<netmask>]
		always <v6addr>[/<prefixlen>]
		always <domain>
			'always' specifies the acceptable address block and the
			acceptable domain name with no restrictions. Even if
			the number of the connections is already same as
			'maxclient', the connection from this address block or
			the domain name never be rejected.

		deny <v4addr>[/<netmask>]
		deny <v6addr>[/<prefixlen>]
		deny <domain>
			'deny' specifies the unacceptable address block and the
			unacceptable domain name. The server always rejects the
			connection from this address block and the domain name.

	'permit' is an alias to 'allow'.
	'reject' is an alias to 'deny'.

	* 0.19.5

2003-04-17  MAEKAWA Masahide  <maekawa@cvsync.org>

	* Fix a bug that the 'SetAttr' request for directories was issued in
	  a wrong order.

2003-04-16  MAEKAWA Masahide  <maekawa@cvsync.org>

	* New feature: loose

	  Background:
	  Proper CVS repositories don't have files with same file name
	  inside/outside 'Attic' directory of the same directory. If both exist
	  accidentally, it is very difficult to determine which file is the
	  right one. So in the past, cvsync exits abnormaly with the
	  'inconsistency' error message. But some CVS repositories has this
	  inconsistency. It is unhappy for CVS repositories mirror sites to
	  redistribute them.

	  The keyword 'loose' provides a workaround for bogus CVS repositories.
	  When cvsync detects a inconsistency, cvsync assumes that the a file
	  with more recent modification time is right and don't exit.

	  This feature is optional. The best way is to remove the
	  inconsistencies from master sites, of course.

	* Fix a bug that when move a RCS file from inside/outside Attic to
	  outside/inside Attic without chaging modifition time and permissions,
	  cvsync cannot detect the action.

	* Fix a bug that a packet length of protocol version is mistakenly
	  calculated.

2003-04-04  MAEKAWA Masahide  <maekawa@cvsync.org>

	* 0.19.0

	* HEADS UP: Change Cvsync Version Exchange Protocol
	  If you use the old versions, please upgrade to 0.19.0 or higher.

	* Improve the performance to update sub-collection.
	  When a server receives an update request of collections
	  defined as sub-collection, the server sends differences
	  of the sub-collection with a relative prefix based on the
	  `super' collection. The client can update only that directory.

	* REMARK:
		AIX 4.3.3 without IPv6
		BSD/OS 4.2
		Cygwin 1.3.22 without IPv6
		FreeBSD/i386 5.0-CURRENT (as of 2003/03/12)
		FreeBSD/i386 4.7-STABLE (as of 2003/03/05)
		FreeBSD/sparc64 5.0-CURRENT (as of 2003/03/05)
		Mac OS X
		NetBSD/alpha 1.6O with native pthreads
		NetBSD/i386 1.6P with native pthreads
		NetBSD/i386 1.6L with GNU Pth
		NetBSD/macppc 1.6M with native pthreads
		OpenBSD/i386 3.2-stable
		OpenBSD/sparc64 3.3-beta
		Red Hat Linux 7.2
		Solaris 8/SPARC

	  Works fine on these platforms.

2003-04-01  MAEKAWA Masahide  <maekawa@cvsync.org>

	* Make this compile on AIX 4.3.3

	* 0.18.0

	* Implement a new keyword 'super', which allows to define
	  sub-collections of a collection. For example:

		collection {
			name netbsd release rcs
			prefix /cvsroot
			...
		}
		collection {
			name netbsd-pkgsrc release rcs
			prefix /cvsroot/pkgsrc
			super netbsd
		}

	  For the collection `netbsd-pkgsrc', a client gets only
	  /cvsroot/pkgsrc part of the whole of NetBSD CVS repository
	  (/cvsroot). When `super' is specified as shown above, 'nofollow'
	  and 'umask' of the collection `netbsd-pkgsrc' with `super' are
	  inherited from the collection `netbsd'. When a scanfile is
	  also specified in the collection `netbsd', the collection
	  `netbsd-pkgsrc' employs the corresponding entries in the parent's
	  scanfile. Thus, using `super' keyword, only a scanfile for the
	  top of sub-collections is needed to use the scanfile functionality
	  when sub-collections of a collection are defined. It makes the use
	  of a scanfile more efficient.

	  'super' can be specified recursively (i.e. a sub-collection can
	  be the parent of another sub-collection).
