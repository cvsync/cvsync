uses a configuration file which specifies collections to distribute CVS
repositories.
Basically it is a free format plain text file whose keywords are separated by
white space(s) and/or carriage return(s).
Comments begin with
.Ql #
and extend to the end of the line.
.Pp

.Ql prefix .
It must be an absolute path.
This keyword is valid in

.It Sy collection "{ ... }"
NOT YET
.It Sy comment Ar string
Describes the information about the collection.
This is available from the remote host by using the release type
.Ql list .
This keyword is valid in
.Ql collection .
.It Sy config "{ ... }"

.It Sy distfile Ar file
NOT YET
.Pp
It must be an absolute path.
This keyword is valid in

.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy abort
Disconnect the client immediately.
.It Sy fixup
Recover errors/conflicts and keep running.
.It Sy ignore
Ignore any errors/conflicts.
.El
.Pp
The default value is
.Ql abort .
This keyword is valid in
.Ql collection .
.It Sy haltfile Ar file
Specifies the file to exit gracefully.
If this file is created or modified when a server is running, the server try
to exit gracefully.
The default value is /var/run/cvsyncd.HALT.
This keyword is valid in
.Ql config .
.It Sy hash Ar type
Specifies the hash type to validate the distributed files and deltas.
.Ql md5
shall be supported in any environments.
.Ql ripemd160 ,
.Ql sha1 ,
.Ql tiger192
and, any other types are optional.

This keyword is valid in
.Ql config .
.It Sy nofollow

.It Sy release Ar type
Specifies a type of collections which are distributed from the server.
When most of files in a collection have a specific format such as
.Xr rcsfile 5 ,
.Nm
can use optimized algorithms to transfer such files.
However, it needs that
.Ql release Ar type
is specified properly.
.Pp
Using
.Ql release Ar type ,
you can specify transfer a file tree itself in a collection or a partial
information of the tree such as a specific revision in
.Xr rcsfile 5 .
This is the reason why
.Nm
does not decide the collection type automatically.
